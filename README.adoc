= CloudBees action: Scan with njsscan

Use this action to perform static application security testing (SAST) on Node.js code with njsscan, a semantic-aware scanner.
You can also use the action output as a quality gate for the next step or job in your workflow.

== Usage examples

=== Basic example

The following is a basic example of using the action:

[source,yaml]
----
      - name: Scan with njsscan SAST scanner
        uses: cloudbees-io/njsscan-hybrid-plugin@v1

----

=== Using the action output

Access the output values in downstream steps and jobs using the `outputs` link:https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-platform/latest/dsl-syntax/contexts[context].

Use the output in your workflow as follows, where <action_step_ID> is the action step ID, and <severity> is an output parameter name, such as `critical-count`:

[source,yaml]
----
${{steps.<action_step_ID>.outputs.<severity>}}
----

The following example uses the action output in a downstream step of the same job:

[source,yaml,role="default-expanded"]

          ls -latR /cloudbees/workspace

      - id: print-outputs-from-njsscan-step
        name: print outputs from upstream njsscan step
        uses: docker://alpine:latest
        run: |
            #printing all outputs
            echo "Outputs from upstream njsscan step:"
            echo "Critical count: ${{steps.njsscan-step.outputs.critical-count}}"
            echo "Very high count: ${{steps.njsscan-step.outputs.very-high-count}}"
            echo "High count: ${{steps.njsscan-step.outputs.high-count}}"
